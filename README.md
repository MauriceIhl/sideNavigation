# sideNavigation
A simple side navigation based on tsx and tailwind in next.js.

You can copy and paste this snippet into your react oder nextjs project. 
There are some properties enabled to overwrite so that you don't have to look up the tailwind styles anytime. 
If you want to use the icon set as well you have to install heroicons with ``npm i @heroicons/react``

Happy coding
